Latin Is For The Birds

In this app, test your knowledge of Latin bird names! A Latin name will be generated randomly for one bird that has made a permanent or temporary home in the United States, and the goal is to correctly answer what is the bird's common name. For instance, you may get 'Ardea herodias' and need to answer 'Great Blue Heron'.

There are two hints provided; the first is a picture of the bird. This is generated by Dall-E via OpenAI (and may not be 100% accurate, as noted on the app). The second is a location that the bird may be found in; this information is garnered from eBird which provides bird sightings.

After the two hints, the answer is provided. Finally, a user can read more about the bird if they want. They can also generate a new Latin name at any time.
